# Snoogens Arena Windwalker Monk v1.0  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/gQ7qvJY.png)  

A PVP only rotation with a specific focus on Arena, however with full support for Battleground usage.  
Supports any level.  
Only compatible with English Language World of Warcraft Client. This means that this rotation won't work for WoW clients with German, Russian etc languages.  
Purchase a license through https://shoppy.gg/@snoogens  
Unzip and place the `Snoogens-Arena-Marksman-Hunter` folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. `X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations`  
Place the `license.txt` file you've recieved by email after purchasing in the `Snoogens-Arena-Marksman-Hunter` folder.  

I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.

Please provide me with your direct feedback on my Discord - https://discord.gg/VksJWWk9PS.

## Disclaimer:  
I can't help you with Aimsharp client issues. If your Aimsharp doesn't work, please fix that first using the Aimsharp Discord.  
Auto Feign Death Interrupt is what it is - i.e. you can never really know if a spell is being cast on you unless they target you (i.e. if they for instance use arena1-3 or focus macros), so it doesn't catch all - but it does catch quite a few, especially offensive spells!

## Advanced Users:  
You can use WeakAuras to see what you've toggled on, it helps to realize if you've kept Burst on but forgot about it.
Here's an example for Burst.  
`!WA:2!fxvZUnsrq4yIIwXCiSyqr7Yfmrak7s0QDbPiUebE8oMKvMeNXtsw4ItptxJNMDC3T6UhNFUG2CApWj)i4ZCYpbOCGRmyTpb7JqEbGQ7XjBccotlzpDxZN6QQV6RQPw76dRtRtF1NoHLi49efQeOwyIixOE2I4sD6UPPAWS13(Z)XF9BlSqTPeEsMq1vW4M4wb7efeolriYPIJ59oMjHJU4QJb0bqMIKyycUEJqTHOmEXPmotN55JpmENBuSbdaLE5pxnF7V7BovcXjfAJy4B0fXWiGB6vKMYozA)wn7f1VxuZWOqN94TasUj7ACDvaIlSx3GoDc5KHG27CTeYZ3MQ9kFp5FMwWDb0Ao4RpiVNrT(isEb8aVg4kxKqYBKmIO2Cv)cL2SQZmlTHdAdcN2Wb3TZzBZnTWByYaUdRDPatHI3Wi4fdJb1AvEyZnFIdbKRb8g5cZnUv7PQB(w3uimGPnGQ1be1AwhT(JRIuGt9WF(firglZjNcQWKmi5fL1NwXE9DmjY7McDf9ON26GMH93V7tBgfmHcXiTgHGuBf0PB797mUGpVmScsw)Y)ZK1JVzEkFFRsAeevfFFVGc)6cxIQqqXj5hGAimq37YxaGSjwXtmHem0Zgt4SH2D8nkF32ZOfk3bh1O0ak6P6YL95coCbq0agIaFGj7oNBpz5MYh6pKW4TlxR8bLlx(WYV4oLRJp8(Nwq(uJun6aiBckiTvou5)rVAfzDdCIPVoJG9fpVQJQ2yNn7FR(zs5DVbIwU2VA1QT4BQSc5PUgo)M7hTR8dCgjfyfgZLKdzutMFt84LUxG6FG6m(YzvnR)WCpEH79)eQnyPNwU0eLaLgqeA0FND3jOCzfg1wmtCaF7uGQqnvWnY72wXoRXEfekMNKgrr3k3UTNgX0S4C4OzUthlu0dve55hoFZSRVvNeC39J6S9obZzIBmMPCj5NCnxH4vyA3x23Wgc9LkiHzR8lkV))cMQnHwO036UESZG7pNBUQAi)4)lxqpfNJWsYIZa2GmZl9ZfeAQVsKdReoSi3W8gxOH(CSjrLfBi5yVYkLD98TYq7MWKCIwxzcDTDZeLtCytCF7K3zy5eJMDLUHLEJVUKxU05xnpnBIvTYQqesYLzKfLF4vV1wgFkttqcNM5BvhztmIKrvng3Rw)XRYOx46sBejgmihNXk4PSbEttv4Gsu4Jf0fdp2PCkp8OVSGrN(J71vTXZA187Y6OyC7LHJ0pz(3e(M1wWTUSIkBBVgBgf3RvyqWotPmTDU02OFU37S0ctz8kMfJNvK3JnGluW8moWoGjqPek9r(NjedRvxh(vp6jp6RRp61p)V)d`  
Import this WeakAura and modify your Burst Toggle macro to look like this:  
`/xxxxx Burst`  
`/run local cvar="Burst" SetCVar(cvar,1-GetCVar(cvar),cvar)`  
It will now toggle an Icon on your screen for when Burst is active.  
Keep in mind that the WeakAura can get "out of sync" if you restart the rotation with this being active etc.  
If you use BurstPrep, expect WeakAuras for Burst and BurstPrep to become completely out of sync.
